Description: Input method configuration framework
 im-config package provides the framework to configure and to switch
 the input method. This input method is the essential mechanism for
 Japanese, Chinese and Korean (CJK) languages to enter their non-ASCII
 native characters.
 .
 Many modern input methods such as IBus support not only one of these CJK
 languages but support almost all languages simultaneously by
 dynamically switching keyboard modes with GUI helper program.
 .
 By installing this package, the most desirable input method and its
 backend conversion engine are automatically configured with both the X
 Window System Input Method (XIM), GTK input method module, Qt input
 method module, and clutter input method module.
 .
 You can further customize your input method with 'im-config' command.
